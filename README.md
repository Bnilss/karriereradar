**Scrape/track job offers from over 400 Bayerische hospitals.**

## The purpose 
To tackle the problem of the over-competitive job market in Bayern state in Germany, by increasing the chances of landing a job as medical personnel (doctor, nurse, etc)
one needs to cover a wide base of hospitals, apply as fast as soon as the job offer is posted, and keep track of all this information.
My solution to this problem is to scrape/gather job posts in the state and display them nicely over a website, using a full-stack web app that runs locally, launched from a GUI (maybe even add a Chrome extension later).

## Features
- easily customizable CSS-selector-based scraping instruction.
- multi-threading for fast processing / multiple requests.
- large database of "Bayerische" hospitals.
- job tracking.
- search and filter by multiple variables.
- locally hosted which means max privacy.
- errors handling and display.
- GUI launcher so not command line.
- check for updates of the instruction file from github.

#### Disclaimer
the main purpose of this repo is to act as *a host* for the .cbot file, to allow the web app to check for **updates**.

## TODO:
- [ ] complete this repo (demo code, screenshots, etc)
- [ ] improve the UI
- [ ] improve deployment
- [ ] checkup/tests
